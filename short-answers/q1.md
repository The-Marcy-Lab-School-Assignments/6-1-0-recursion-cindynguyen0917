# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is a function that calls itself. In recursive functions there are two "cases" that exist, the base case and recursive case. The base case is what allows us to exit what seems like an infinite loop of a function calling itself, it signifies when an input has become so small, we hard-code a returned value instead of calling the function again. The recursive case is when the function is called with a new input each loop.
