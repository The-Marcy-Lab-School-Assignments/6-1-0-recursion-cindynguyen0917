# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
The benefits of writing functions recursively include the fact that solutions and code can be easier to read and write. Also getting used to writing recursive functions will help improve fluency when it comes to tranversing certain abstract data types such as graphs and tree nodes which are inherently recursive. Howeever, the drawbacks include an increase of memory taken up and slower code. The reason for these drawbacks is because of the nature of recursive functions, each time the function is called it will be stored on the callstack and invoking functions are slow operations.
