# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
The best type of problems to use recursion for are when the structure of the problem is naturally recursive (trees and graphs) and when a base case exists. Another way to put it is for a problem that nested `n` amount of times-- for example, you can think a folder path, this path is not exactly clear because folders could have subfolders that have subfolders. We don't exactly know how folders can be nested within each other-- making the structure branch out.
